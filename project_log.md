## Looking into cointegration:

Found [this](https://hudsonthames.org/an-introduction-to-cointegration/) useful. 
## Begun a jupyter notebook
Exploring yfinance and pandas python libraries, using Coca-Cola Company([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/)) and PepsiCo Inc([PEP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/)) as my stocks for practicing with.
